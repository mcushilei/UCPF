/* \note    This is a incoming header file. This file aims to define macroes to 
 *          set up it's own properties, which is not relevant to other modules. 
 *          e.g. to decide whether a function will be enabled or a parameter to
 *          be used in that module. The porting part which of course will depend
 *          on others, for example, a type, a prototype, a macro funtion etc
 *          should be in the xxx_plug.h file.
