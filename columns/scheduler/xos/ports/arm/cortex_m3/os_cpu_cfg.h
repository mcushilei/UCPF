*                                      Critical Section Management
*
* Method #1:  Disable/Enable interrupts using simple instructions.  After critical section, interrupts
*             will be enabled even if they were disabled before entering the critical section. This
*             critical section could not be nested.
*
* Method #2:  Disable/Enable interrupts by preserving the state of interrupts.  The disabling interrupt
*             will increase a counter and it will be decreased before restoring the interrupt state.
*             The interrupt will only be enabled if the counter reaches 0.
*             In other words, if interrupts were disabled before entering the critical section, they
*             will be disabled when leaving the critical section.
*
* Method #3:  Disable/Enable interrupts by preserving the state of interrupts.  Generally speaking you
*             would store the state of the interrupt disable flag in the local variable 'cpu_sr' and then
*             disable interrupts.  'cpu_sr' is allocated in all of OS's functions that need to
*             disable interrupts.  You would restore the interrupt disable state by copying back 'cpu_sr'
*             into the CPU's status register.
